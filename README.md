# A Stinky & Simple Connect 4 Game.
A connect4 repository using HTML, heavily referenced from a video, while also adding some small extra bits, and changing color values, as I'm not a fan of bright colors, a bit more toned down is my style.
The following video was referenced to understand the Javascript portion -> https://youtu.be/4ARsthVnCTg?si=DJRLdPUf-OAKE152
(Yes, heavy reference... I don't even feel proud much of myself, but I underestimated the difficulty of understanding a code with a similar name to a code I have somewhat experience, but have not practiced for a long while. Also being busy with several homework assignments and procrastination did not help much...)
