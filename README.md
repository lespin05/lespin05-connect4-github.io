# A Stinky & Simple Connect 4 Game.
Welcome to an updated version of the Stinky & Simple Connecr 4 Game, now with Multiplayer Support via Node.js
Simply download the files, connect via localhost, make sure to input port 3002, and you should be set to battle!

Known Issues & Bugs:
- A turn system is not set, so players can technically sabotage each other... I guess that can challenge each other's trust.
- I'm pretty sure many players can join, ensuring chaos, so embrace it while it lasts!

Things yet to implement/Test:
- Check if the game keeps updates if a player leaves midmatch and a new one joins.
- Implement turn system so it's truly a 1vs1, thought that might be difficult to do...
- Update code to make it cleaner, as well as adding comments to make it easier to read.
- Maybe update html to notify of known bugs?

As always, that's all I have to offer, see you in another stinky project.
(Also, big reference in rewards to script.js to make the code work -> https://youtu.be/4ARsthVnCTg?si=DJRLdPUf-OAKE152)

[The following work is made for school assignment purposes, majority of code (mainly script.js) has been referenced by the linked source, if for some reason someone outside of the school finds this webpage... uhhh... howdy]
